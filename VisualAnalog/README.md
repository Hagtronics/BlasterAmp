VisualAnalog ADC Data Analysis Script  
=====================================
This script is to be used with the Analog Devices, Inc. VisualAnalog design tool.  
VisualAnalog includes a comprehensive analysis routine that can take any real ADC data from a text file and analyze it. I include a simple script and some sample ADC data.  
I use this for analyzing ADC circuits that I design.  
  
Read the attached Instructions PDF for how to use.  

You are free to do anything you like with this script, but neither I or Analog Devices can be held liable for any inaccuracies. Like everything, test it yourself before you believe it!   ;-)
